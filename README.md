# Rocketmiles - React Technical Assesment

## Notes
The 'master' branch contains my application code for submission to this assessment. The same instructions that follow apply for starting the app.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:1234`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/).
